# [:bulb:] Why?

<p align="justify">
This project resonates deeply with my personal quest for guidance and inspiration in a world that can often feel overwhelming. Through my own experiences, I have found that mantras and uplifting phrases can serve as powerful tools for cultivating awareness, pursuing goals, and prioritizing what truly matters. It occurred to me that if these practices have been so beneficial to me, then perhaps they could help others as well. That's why I feel compelled to share this project with those who may be facing similar challenges and seeking greater purpose and clarity in their lives.
