## :bulb: - Why?

<p align="justify">
This project connects with my personal need of having mantras and inspiring phrases to lead me throughout this chaotic world. I believe they've helped me a couple of times to be more aware, to chase down my goals and to focus on what matters, so why not sharing it with more people who might be in the same situation as me?
